This is a very small helper app for ssh-agent.

Example setup:

- run the razor-config-session.
- add new item into the "Environment (Advanced)"
   SSH_ASKPASS=razor-openssh-askpass
-if you want to register your keys on session startup add new item to "Autostart" tab. For example:
   name: ssh-add
   command: ssh-add
   wait for system tray: false
- logout/login/enjoy
